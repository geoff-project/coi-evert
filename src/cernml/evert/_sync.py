    This assumes that *solve* is a function that receives a second
    function which it will call many times before eventually returning
    a result. This includes most numerical optimization algorithms.

    The returned `Eversion` object has methods `~Eversion.ask()` and
    `~Eversion.tell()` that manually progress the state machine inside
    *solve*, meaning that you can run it without yielding the control
    flow.

        solve: the function to turn inside out.
        x0: the second parameter to *solve* beside the callback
            function. Most numerical optimization algorithms will pass
            this directly to the first call to the objective.
        debug: if True, run the internal event loop in debug mode. If
            False, disable debug mode. If None (the default), respect
            the global debug settings.
        loop_factory: if passed and not None, use this to create an
