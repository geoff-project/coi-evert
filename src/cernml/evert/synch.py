"""Synchronous, blocking version of the Eversion API.

Many optimization routines are implemented as a function called *solve*
that takes a callback function *objective* and an initial argument *x0*.
The *solve* function then runs a loop, potentially for a long time, and
calls *objective* repeatedly until it has calculated a result.
Because *solve* seizes the *control flow*, its caller is stuck waiting
for however long it takes and cannot do anything else.

Example:

    >>> def solve(objective, x0):
    ...     x = x0
    ...     for i in range(1, 4):
    ...         loss = objective(x)
    ...         x = f"args {i}"
    ...         print("solve received:", loss)
    ...     print("solve finished")
    ...     return "final result"
    ...
    >>> with evert(solve, "args 0") as ev:
    ...     i = 0
    ...     while True:
    ...         i += 1
    ...         try:
    ...             print("main received:", ev.ask())
    ...         except OptFinished as exc:
    ...             print("main received:", exc.result)
    ...             break
    ...         ev.tell(f"result {i}")
    main received: args 0
    solve received: result 1
    main received: args 1
    solve received: result 2
    main received: args 2
    solve received: result 3
    solve finished
    main received: final result

.. note::
    This API uses :doc:`asynch` behind the scenes. If you run any
    asynchronous code yourself, keep in mind that entering the eversion
    context via :keyword:`with` will necessarily manipulate the global
    event loop. If you don't run any asynchronous code, there is nothing
    you need to worry about.

            debug settings.
